# Rock-vs.-paper
This CNN architecture leverages convolutional layers to extract hierarchical features from input images, making it effective for distinguishing between rocks and paper based on visual patterns and textures. Adjustments to hyperparameters and network depth may be necessary based on specific dataset characteristics and performance requirements.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Rock vs. Paper Classification

1. Input Layer:

The network takes grayscale or RGB images of rocks and paper as inputs. These images are typically preprocessed to a standard size (e.g., 128x128 pixels) and normalized.
2. Convolutional Layers:

Convolutional Layer 1: Applies 32 filters of size 3x3, extracting basic features like edges and textures from the input images.
Activation (ReLU): Introduces non-linearity after each convolution operation.
Max Pooling: Reduces the spatial dimensions (downsampling) to capture the most important features. Typically uses a 2x2 window with a stride of 2.
3. Convolutional Layers (Continued):

Convolutional Layer 2: Increases the depth to 64 with 3x3 filters, capturing more complex patterns.
Activation (ReLU): Applies element-wise non-linearity.
Max Pooling: Further downsamples the features, maintaining the most relevant information.
4. Flattening:

Converts the 2D matrix into a 1D vector, preparing the data for input into fully connected layers.
5. Fully Connected Layers:

Fully Connected Layer 1: 128 neurons, allowing the network to learn high-level features.
Activation (ReLU): Introduces non-linearity to the fully connected layer.
Dropout: Regularization technique to prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of input units to zero during training.
6. Output Layer:

Fully Connected Layer 2 (Output Layer): 2 neurons (for rock and paper classes).
Activation (Softmax): Outputs a probability distribution over the classes, indicating the likelihood of each image belonging to either rock or paper.
7. Training:

Uses categorical cross-entropy loss function to measure the difference between predicted and actual distributions.
Optimized using Adam optimizer with learning rate adjustment.
8. Evaluation:

Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score used to evaluate model effectiveness on a validation set.
Confusion matrix and ROC curves can also be used for deeper analysis.
9. Deployment:

Once trained and evaluated, the model can classify new images of rocks and paper accurately, suitable for deployment in applications requiring automated image classification.
