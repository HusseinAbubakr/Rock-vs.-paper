# Rock-vs.-paper
This CNN architecture leverages convolutional layers to extract hierarchical features from input images, making it effective for distinguishing between rocks and paper based on visual patterns and textures. Adjustments to hyperparameters and network depth may be necessary based on specific dataset characteristics and performance requirements.
